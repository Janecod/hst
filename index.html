<div class="question" href="#question1">
<h2>What is an NFT?</h2>
<i class="fa-solid fa-plus icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>A non-fungible token, or NFT, is a digital asset used to represent ownership of unique items or access, whether digital or physical. Most commonly, they are used for digital collectibles. Ownership and transfer of an NFT is secured by the Solana blockchain, which ensures that one NFT only has one owner at any given time, and that nobody can modify the history of the tokenâ€™s ownership.

<i class="fa-solid fa-plus icon"></i>

<p>This NFT is minted on the Solana blockchain

<div class="question" href="#question2">
<h2>Why SOL?</h2>
<i class="fa-solid fa-plus icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Solana is getting lot of attention for new cryptocurrencies users, Solana is also a platform that can be used to build software, known as decentralized applications. The original NFT standard was developed on Ethereum, but today Solana has become the blockchain which sees the highest volume of NFT transactions.</p>

<div class="question" href="#question2">
<h2>What is a "digital wallet"?</h2>
<i class="fa-solid fa-plus icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>A blockchain wallet is a digital storage that enables you to store and transact with cryptocurrency. In its simplest form, a wallet comprises a public and private key, which are cryptographically generated.<br><br>
                            To make the process of setting up a wallet user-friendly, there are many software wallets, such as Solflare, which equip you with a wallet address, key vault, secure login, and backup options to manage your digital assets securely. Solflare runs as a browser extension and/or mobile app, and you can be up and running in just a couple of minutes. Learn more at Solflare FAQ.<br><br>
                            With a digital wallet, you hold the keys and are in charge of your own assets. Your assets are only as safe as your keys, so back them up and keep them safe! Remember to never, ever share your seed phrase to anyone. That is for your eyes only.</p>

<div class="question" href="#question2">
<h2>What is Gas/Gwei or minting fees?</h2>
<i class="fa-solid fa-plus icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Gas fees or minting fees are a transaction fee on the Solana blockchain. When you make transactions, such as purchasing an NFT, you will need enough SOL in your wallet for the initial purchase and the associated gas fees. The gas fee enables your transaction to be logged on the Solana network.<br><br>
                            The price of gas is volatile and fluctuates based on the supply of miners who receive the gas for the transaction vs. the demand from consumers making transactions. A user enters the gas price they want to pay, a suggested fee is always shown by the wallet you are using (e.g. Metamask) to make the transaction. If the cost of the gas price exceeds the fee you offered to pay, your transaction could fail, and the gas fee will be lost without the transaction confirming.<br><br>
                            Gas fees are taken by Solana. Lost gas fees are non-refundable. Move forward at your own risk.</p>

<div class="question" href="#question2">
<h2>How do i purchase (SOL)?</h2>
<i class="fa-solid fa-plus icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>You can purchase SOL through an online exchange such as Coinbase. Once you have purchased SOL, you can transfer the funds into your Phantom or another compatible wallet to purchase an NFT. Please keep in mind that there are limits on the amounts of SOL you can buy and sell based on your account and the platform you're using.
                        </p>

<div class="question" href="#question2">
<h2>What is an NFT marketplace</h2>
<i class="fa-solid fa-plus icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>NFT marketplaces enable creators and collectors to buy, sell and create. After connecting your wallet, you can purchase, auction or sell a wide range of NFTs. The leading open NFT marketplace for SOL is Magic Eden. This is also referred to as the secondary market.
